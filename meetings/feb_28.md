# Notes

### Conversation with Apurva
 - Check Perkins break, see if it matches our break
 - Eric is super busy
 - DIY Light up cane tip that lights up the area of the floor,
  specifically designed for students with CVI (Cortical visual impairments)
 - Eric is a huge resource, ask Eric about different types of students,
   "What kind of students would use this tool? Why or why not?"
 - Perkins Tour, Don't be afraid to ask questions.

### Questions for Eric
- Could you tell us about the general groups of kids you teach?
- Do you have a specific group of students in mind for this year's project?
    (For example, students with a specific type of visual impairments?)
- How long does a typical O+M training last? How long would some kind of game be?
- What are the major or the most important concrete skills you want the students to learn from the training activities or games?
- Are the any major blocks to learning? (Motivation, too much time spent on setup, etc..)
- How much space do students have? How much space do you have in mind for these training activities?
- What games do you already use? Are there any obvious problems or improvements that could be done?
- What are your thoughts on individual activities vs team activities? Do you have a preference, and if so, why?
