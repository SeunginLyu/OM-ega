# Notes

### Conversation with Apurva
 - Check Perkins break, see if it matches our break
 - Eric is super busy
 - DIY Light up cane tip that lights up the area of the floor,
  specifically designed for students with CVI (Cortical visual impairments)
 - Eric is a huge resource, ask Eric about different types of students,
   "What kind of students would use this tool? Why or why not?"
 - Perkins Tour, Don't be afraid to ask questions.
